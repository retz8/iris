# 1-Track-C Summary — Welcome Email Refinement

**Status:** Done
**File changed:** `snippet/n8n-workflows/workflow-confirmation.md` Node 11

## Changes Made

| # | Change | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Subject: `Welcome to Snippet - Code Reading Challenge` → `Welcome to Snippet` | "Code Reading Challenge" reads like an event, not a newsletter |
| 2 | Removed "Smart move." | Flattery inconsistent with the newsletter's unsentimental tone |
| 3 | Merged AI sentence and ownership sentence into one paragraph | Removed `<br>` — reads as one continuous thought |
| 4 | Removed challenge bullet ("Challenge: What's this actually doing?") | Implicit from the format; no need to spell it out |
| 5 | Removed "Copyable code. 2-minute read. Real skill-building." | Redundant with bullets; "Real skill-building" is an unsubstantiated claim |
| 6 | Removed "First one Monday." | Schedule already covered by the bullet header; inaccurate for mid-week signups |
| 7 | Snippet bullet elevated: "One snippet from a repo engineers are reading this week (8–12 lines)" | "Trending OSS project" undersold the real value — timely, real, traceable code |
| 8 | Added third bullet: "Project context: where the code came from" | Reflects actual newsletter structure; reinforces the real-code angle |

## Subject Line Decision

Considered adding "newsletter" to the subject. Decided against it: this email lands immediately after the subscriber clicks confirm — they have full context. The body establishes the format within two seconds of opening. No label needed.

## Final Copy

Subject: Welcome to Snippet

You signed up for Snippet.

AI generates code faster than you can read it. But you're still the one who reviews it, merges it, owns it.

Can you read it well enough to trust it?

Every Mon/Wed/Fri, 7am:
- One snippet from a repo engineers are reading this week (8–12 lines)
- Breakdown: The pattern you need to see faster
- Project context: where the code came from

Train your eye. Ship with confidence.
