How much do you actually trust code written by AI?


I've been running multiple Claude Code agents in parallel lately. The output is genuinely fast — code coming in from every direction.

And honestly?

I've merged things I hadn't fully read.

Not because I was careless.
Because the pace made it hard to keep up.

That stuck with me.

Everyone is talking about vibe coding, Codex, Claude Code - the speed of generation is the whole conversation right now.

But no one's talking about the other side.

That part didn't get faster. The gap just got wider.

Skills don't close through awareness. They improve through repetition.

That’s why I built something for myself first.

𝗦𝗻𝗶𝗽𝗽𝗲𝘁 is a free newsletter: twice a week, a real snippet from a trending repo lands in your inbox. You read it before the breakdown. You train the part that didn’t get automated.

Think Duolingo — but for reading code.
