How much do you actually trust code written by AI?

I've been running multiple Claude Code agents in parallel lately.
The output is genuinely fast — code coming in from every direction.
And honestly? I've merged things I hadn't fully read.

Not because I was careless. Because the pace made it hard to keep up.

That stayed with me.

Everyone is talking about vibe coding, Codex, Claude Code — the speed of generation is the whole conversation right now.

But no one's talking about the other side.

Review is still reading. Reading is still understanding.
That part didn't get faster. The gap just got wider.

So I built something small to close it — 2 minutes, three times a week.
Link in comments if you've felt this too.
