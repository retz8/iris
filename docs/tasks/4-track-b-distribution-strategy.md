# 4-Track-B — Distribution Strategy

**Phase:** 4
**Track:** B
**Scope:** Discuss and document a concrete first-distribution plan for Snippet — who to target, where to promote, and how to get the first subscribers.

**Dependencies:** Phase 3 all tracks must be complete (product is ready to share).

**Deliverables:**
- `snippet/distribution-plan.md` — a concrete, prioritized list of distribution channels and actions

**Out of scope:**
- Paid advertising
- Building any new marketing pages or tools
- Long-term growth strategy — focus is on getting the first real subscribers

**Skills:**
- `sequential-thinking` — for evaluating and prioritizing channels by effort vs expected return
- `lead-research-assistant` — for identifying specific communities, subreddits, newsletters, or people to target

## Phase 1 — Explore

Read the following to understand the product and its positioning:

1. `docs/philosophy-and-vision.md` — understand the core belief and who this is for
2. `web/` main landing page component — read the actual copy to understand how Snippet is currently positioned to visitors
3. `snippet/n8n-workflows/workflow-confirmation.md` Node 11 (welcome email) — read the welcome email copy for the brand voice

After reading, answer these questions:

- Who is the clearest target subscriber? (role, context, frustration)
- What is the hook that would make someone subscribe immediately?
- Where do these people spend time online — which communities, platforms, newsletters?
- What is the lowest-effort, highest-signal first channel to try?
- Are there any existing personal networks or communities the human engineer already has access to?

---

## Phase 2 — Discuss

Present findings to the human engineer:

1. Describe the target subscriber in one concrete sentence — role, context, why Snippet matters to them.
2. Propose 3–5 specific channels ranked by effort vs expected return.
3. For each channel, propose a specific first action (e.g. "post in X subreddit with this framing", "share in Y Slack community").
4. Discuss which channels the human engineer has direct access to vs which require cold outreach.
5. Agree on the first 2–3 actions to take at launch.

## Phase 3 — Plan

Not needed. This track produces a strategy doc, not an implementation plan.

---

## Phase 4 — Execute

Write `snippet/distribution-plan.md` covering:

- Target subscriber profile (one paragraph)
- Prioritized channel list with rationale
- First actions — specific, concrete, immediately actionable
- What to track to know if it's working (signups per channel if possible)

Verification:
- Human engineer reads the plan and confirms every action is specific enough to execute without further discussion
