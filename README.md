> **"IRIS prepares developers to read code, not explains code."**

IRIS is an intelligent abstraction layer designed to bridge the gap between raw source code and natural language. Unlike traditional documentation tools or AI chat assistants that provide passive summaries, IRIS builds a **Progressive Abstraction Layer**—a high-fidelity "Table of Contents" that establishes a mental framework before a developer ever touches the implementation.
